    //Given a set of positive numbers, find if we can partition it into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.
    //Given a set of positive numbers, determine if a subset exists whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.
    //Given a set of positive numbers, partition the set into two subsets with minimum difference between their subset sums.
    //Given a set of positive numbers, find the total number of subsets whose sum is equal to a given number ‘S’.
    //You are given a set of positive numbers and a target sum ‘S’. Each number should be assigned either a ‘+’ or ‘-’ sign.
    //     We need to find the total ways to assign symbols to make the sum of the numbers equal to the target ‘S’.
